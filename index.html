  <h1>Hi, I'm Patrick</h1>
</section>
<section>
  <p>I like to think of myself as a human swiss army knife – able to fold into the correct configuration to accomplish the task at hand. I seek out work that is meaningful, challenging, and fun. I've found that I'm at my happiest when I feel useful to the people around me.</p>
  <p>I spent some time this year serving as the COO at CreativeMornings as they moved through a transitional period. Before that, I spent nearly a <em>decade</em> with the team at <strong><a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a></strong>, where I did a little bit of everything. I'm currently exploring new ideas and opportunities. Feel free to give a shout!<br>
  <p>Other things I've done:</p>
